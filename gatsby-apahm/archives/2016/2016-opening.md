description: "Figurative and material threads represent the narratives of Asian Pacific Americans from the past to present. The weaving of these individual threads into a unified piece of fabric reveal the intricacy of APIA relationships and history. Each distinctive thread plays an important role; the absence of one leads to the unraveling of others. This April, APAHM will weave personal stories into “mosaics” displaying the diversity of APIA issues and cultures."
